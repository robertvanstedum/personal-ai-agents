## Deep Dive Analysis: Monthly Statement of Public Debt (January 2026)

### 1. Why This Matters
The Monthly Statement of the Public Debt (MSPD) provides the authoritative record of U.S. government obligations, critical for understanding fiscal sustainability, debt service costs, and investor confidence in Treasury securities. Changes in debt composition (bills vs. bonds, domestic vs. foreign holdings) signal shifts in government financing strategy and market conditions that affect interest rates, inflation expectations, and the dollar's reserve currency status.

### 2. Core Argument
This dataset presents the official breakdown of outstanding Treasury securities by type, maturity, and holder category as of January 31, 2026. The MSPD serves as the primary source for tracking gross public debt versus debt held by the public, intragovernmental holdings, and the specific instruments used to finance government operations.

### 3. Contrarian Take
- Critics argue that gross debt figures obscure what matters most: debt-to-GDP ratio and debt service costs relative to revenue, not absolute numbers
- Focusing on monthly snapshots without examining velocity of change, maturity profiles, or real interest rates provides incomplete fiscal health assessment

### 4. Connections
Track this data alongside Federal Reserve balance sheet changes (quantitative tightening/easing), CBO long-term budget projections, foreign official holdings reports (TIC data), and comparative OECD sovereign debt statistics to contextualize trends against monetary policy, fiscal trajectory, and international capital flows.

### 5. Key Data
Without access to the specific January 2026 figures, key metrics to extract include: total public debt outstanding, debt held by the public, intragovernmental holdings, weighted average maturity, breakdown by security type (bills/notes/bonds/TIPS), and month-over-month change in total debt.

### 6. Next Questions
- How has the maturity profile shifted over the past 12-24 months, and what does this signal about refinancing risk?
- What is the current proportion of floating-rate exposure versus fixed-rate debt?
- How do U.S. debt-to-GDP ratios and trajectories compare to Japan, EU members, UK, and China?
- What are CBO's latest 10-year and 30-year debt projections under current law versus alternative scenarios?
