## Your Interest

This is one of the most important issues of the day.  It could be a major shock if the tariff revenue must be refunded, especially with deficits so high and this having helped last year.  I hear Sec. Bessent say they have other options.  What are they?  Also, it seems best for Congress to pass law but that would need the filibuster to end, I believe.

## Deep Dive Analysis

# Analysis: Ex-CIA Analyst on US Information Operations in Iran

## 1. Why This Matters
This appears to be **completely unrelated to your stated interest in tariff revenue and federal deficits**. The article discusses alleged US regime-change operations in Iran through "Operational Preparation of the Environment" (OPE). The ZeroHedge source and timing (future-dated to 2026, likely an error) raise credibility questions.

## 2. Core Argument
Former CIA analyst Larry Johnson claims the US is conducting information operations and pre-positioning intelligence assets in Iran as preparation for potential military action or regime change. Evidence cited appears limited to the definition of OPE from military doctrine.

## 3. Contrarian Take
- Critics would note ZeroHedge's reputation for conspiracy theories and unverified claims
- Standard intelligence activities don't necessarily indicate imminent regime change operations; could be routine contingency planning

## 4. Connections
Relates to broader US-Iran tensions, Middle East geopolitical dynamics, and historical US regime-change controversies (Iraq, Libya, Syria). Echoes debates about information warfare and "color revolutions."

## 5. Key Data
- **OPE definition**: "non-intelligence activities conducted prior to or in preparation for potential military operations"
- Source: Joint Publication 3-05 (Special Operations doctrine)

## 6. Next Questions
- What specific evidence exists of current US OPE activities in Iran beyond doctrine definitions?
- How does this relate to current US-Iran diplomatic status?
- What is Larry Johnson's track record on previous analytical claims?
- Why is this article dated 2026?
