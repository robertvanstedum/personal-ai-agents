## Your Interest

I think this is really econ 101 and overlooks the political near term impact.  The way a company works in the real world is the AI will allow the company to do more with less.  The "AI Effective" will stay.  However, that is not how layoffs work.  They will layoff a lot of smart "AI effective" employees.  This is a sickle harvest, not picking one by one.  Those workers will struggle to find work because all existing companies need less workers.  The lag from new companies needing new workers will not avoid years of pain.

## Deep Dive Analysis

## 1. Why This Matters
The St. Louis Fed is signaling that AI displacement may force workers to permanently exit employment rather than transition to new roles—a fundamental shift from historical automation patterns. This validates concerns about structural unemployment rather than just temporary displacement, with significant implications for social safety nets, labor force participation rates, and inequality.

## 2. Core Argument
The Fed's model suggests AI improvements create a "skill obsolescence" effect where certain labor types become economically unviable, not just temporarily displaced. Unlike previous automation waves, AI's ability to perform cognitive tasks may eliminate entire occupational categories without creating equivalent substitute roles at the same skill levels.

## 3. Contrarian Take
- **Historical precedent**: Every major technological shift (electricity, computers, internet) initially appeared job-destroying but ultimately expanded employment through productivity gains and new sectors
- **Political Economy blind spot**: The model assumes efficient market clearing; it ignores that employment outcomes depend heavily on policy interventions, retraining programs, and redistribution mechanisms that can prevent labor force exit

## 4. Connections
Ties to declining prime-age labor force participation since 2000, "deaths of despair" research in deindustrialized communities, and emerging debates about Universal Basic Income as automation accelerates. Parallels the "China shock" literature showing trade displacement effects persisted far longer than models predicted.

## 5. Key Data
The article itself is conceptual/theoretical—no specific statistics provided. The Fed is using "a simple economic model" for long-run projections, suggesting qualitative framework rather than empirical analysis. Notable that a Federal Reserve bank is publicly discussing permanent labor force exit scenarios.

## 6. Next Questions
- What is the historical lag time between automation waves and new job creation across previous technological transitions?
- Which specific occupational categories does BLS data show declining versus growing in AI-exposed sectors 2020-2025?
- How do mass layoff events (WARN notice data) correlate with firm-level AI adoption rates?
- What percentage of displaced workers in previous automation waves (1980s manufacturing) permanently exited vs. found comparable work?
