## Your Interest

I just read headline, but blocking starlink and later in-space attacks on satellite will be an issue.  I'm sure China does not want Ukraine type communications in the Philippens or South china see.

## Deep Dive Analysis

## 1. Why This Matters

China's alleged Starlink jamming near Scarborough Shoal represents a tactical escalation in the South China Sea territorial dispute and validates concerns about space-based communications as critical military infrastructure. This incident demonstrates that satellite internet systems like Starlink—which proved decisive in Ukraine's resistance—are vulnerable to electronic warfare and will become primary targets in future conflicts. The Philippines' reliance on commercial satellite systems for maritime operations exposes the fragility of modern military communications in contested regions.

## 2. Core Argument

China is actively testing and deploying electronic warfare capabilities to neutralize commercial satellite communications that could enable adversaries to coordinate resistance operations similar to Ukraine's model. The timing—during Philippine Coast Guard patrols protecting fishing vessels—suggests intentional signaling that China can deny communications in disputed waters regardless of technological advantages Western-aligned nations possess.

## 3. Contrarian Take

- Technical disruption could be atmospheric interference, equipment malfunction, or non-intentional signal congestion rather than deliberate Chinese jamming
- Starlink's equatorial coverage limitations and known service gaps in the South China Sea region may explain outages without requiring electronic warfare explanation

## 4. Connections

This connects to broader patterns: Russia's GPS jamming in Eastern Europe and the Black Sea, growing anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons development by China/Russia/India, and the militarization of commercial space infrastructure. The Philippines recently strengthened defense ties with the US, making communications infrastructure a strategic vulnerability China would naturally target.

## 5. Key Data

- Location: Scarborough Shoal (disputed feature 120 nautical miles from Philippines)
- Assets deployed: 4 Philippine patrol vessels, 1 aircraft
- Date: February 24, 2026 (Monday patrol operations)
- Service affected: Starlink satellite internet

## 6. Next Questions

- What specific jamming frequencies and techniques would be required to disrupt Starlink's Ku/Ka-band communications?
- Does the Philippines have documented evidence (spectrum analysis, signal logs) proving intentional jamming versus service disruption?
- How does Starlink's anti-jamming capability compare to military SATCOM systems, and what are its technical vulnerabilities?
- What are China's known electronic warfare capabilities in the South China Sea, particularly around Scarborough Shoal and nearby installations?
